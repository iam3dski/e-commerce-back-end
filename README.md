  ## User Story
  ```md
  AS A manager at an internet retail company
  I WANT a back end for my e-commerce website that uses the latest technologies
  SO THAT my company can compete with other e-commerce companies
  ```

  ## Acceptance Criteria
  ```md
GIVEN a functional Express.js API
WHEN I add my database name, MySQL username, and MySQL password  
to an environment variable file
THEN I am able to connect to a database using Sequelize
WHEN I enter schema and seed commands
THEN a development database is created and is seeded with test data
WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
THEN my server is started and the Sequelize models are synced  
to the MySQL database
WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia Core for categories, products,  
or tags
THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted  
JSON
WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia Core
THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete data in  
my database
  ```
  
  ## Installation 
  
* Clone the repository.

  ``` bash
    DB_NAME = ""
    DB_USER = ""
    DB_PW = ""
  ```

  Seed the database
   ``` bash
    npm run seed
